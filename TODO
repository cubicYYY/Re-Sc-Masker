- If we found that a Z3 var refers to a RAND var, directly replace it!
- Remove a symbol after the last use
  - If it is not used at all then remove it directly
- Allow multiple assignments to a var (update-able symbol table)
- Allow removing var out-of-scope from the symbol table
- Unified interfaces of passes
